Huh!

"Where am I?", you think to yourself. You were just in bed scrolling through TikTok
and BAM you were knocked out.

You look around you and notice a weird device sitting in front of you on a table.

A mysterious voice begins speaking from the distance.

Welcome to the Quantum Music Box Challenge

Researchers at the CIA have recently come into possession
of this strange device allegedly from the future. Allegedly,
this peculiar box holds secrets to prevent the Quantum War that
doomed our future. 

The device apparently asks for the chord progression that only the
chosen one knows. What's worse is that the NSA cryptanalysts have been 
unable to brute force the progression because it apparently only 
accepts strange futuristic quantum circuits as an input. 

3 letter agencies have been looking around the world to find the chosen one.
They found that you are the CHOSEN ONE. It turns out that one of your kindergarten 
teachers was a time traveller who hid the code safely in your memories.

THE FATE OF THE WORLD RESTS IN YOUR HANDS.
