Drive Safe!

2019-12-23

Remember to drive safely, particularly so during unfavourable conditions such as heavy snow, ice, fog, rain and strong winds. The following tips will help you to drive safely in these conditions:
- Drive slowly and carefully.
- Keep a safe distance from the vehicle in front.
- Keep your headlights on.
- Use your wipers and washers.
- Use your horn to warn other road users.
- Be aware of the road surface and the road conditions.
- Be aware of the weather, traffic and visibility conditions.
- Be aware of the road signs and markings.
- Keep in mind that pedestrians may appear from literally anywhere under low visibility conditions, of which there are aplenty such places in our city, and may not be clearly visible regardless of their clothing or stature.
- Stay focused and patient; excitement or fatigue from work, exams, flag hoarding or other personal events may lead to accidents.
